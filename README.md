# Transfer_Learning_Demo


## content

This tutorial explains the concepts and motivations behind transfer learning and seeks to provide an example of the technique used in practice. When tackling a machine learning problem, we often do not have enough training data in the domain we are interested in, but there is sufficient data available in a related domain. Transfer learning takes advantage of the available data to train a model for our target domain. Transfer learning has been shown to improve performance and reduce the costs of acquiring more labeled data. This tutorial will focus on applying transfer learning to deep neural networks for image classification problems, using a feature extraction (embedding) approach with classical computing and a classical-quantum computing hybrid approach. We will first explain the methods and formal concepts behind transfer learning, and then provide an example to measure and understand its performance.
